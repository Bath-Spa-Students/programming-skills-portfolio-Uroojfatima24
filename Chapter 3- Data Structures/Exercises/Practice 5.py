'''You have given a Python list. Write a program to find value 20 in the list, and if it is present, 
replace it with 200. Only update the first occurrence of an item.
Work with the given list:
 list1 = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 50, 20]'''

# Given list
list1 = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 50, 20]

# Find the index of the first occurrence of 20
index_of_20 = list1.index(20)

# Replace the value at the found index with 200
list1[index_of_20] = 200

# Print the updated list
print(list1)
